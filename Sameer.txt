My name is Sameer Choudhary, and I come from Guler, Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, a place that’s shaped my outlook with its calm surroundings, grounded lifestyle, and a sense of steady determination. Growing up in the hills teaches you a lot—patience, discipline, and the value of doing things the right way instead of rushing for shortcuts. I carry that mindset with me as I begin my journey in the world of technology.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab. I started my degree in 2025, and I’m expected to complete it in 2029. Being in my first year, everything feels fresh and exciting, but also challenging in that good, “this will make me better” way. LPU’s diverse atmosphere pushes me to grow, both academically and personally. Meeting people from different backgrounds and cultures every day is a reminder that learning isn’t just limited to textbooks—it also comes from experiences, conversations, and the environment you surround yourself with.

Right now, I’m building my foundation in the core areas of web development and programming. I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, taking my time to understand how things really work under the hood. I’m not in a hurry to claim I know everything; instead, I’m focused on mastering the basics because that’s what sets strong developers apart. The process of writing code, fixing bugs, and finally getting things to work feels satisfying in a way that’s hard to explain—like solving a puzzle piece by piece until the whole picture makes sense.

Coming from Himachal Pradesh, I’ve always believed in staying humble while staying hungry for improvement. My traditional upbringing reminds me to value hard work, respect, and consistency. At the same time, being part of the tech world pushes me to be curious and innovative. It’s a good balance—holding onto my roots while stepping into a future full of possibilities.

As I move ahead in my degree, I hope to explore areas like web development, software engineering, and maybe even the fields of AI or cybersecurity once I’ve built enough core knowledge. For now, my focus is on learning, practicing, and improving day by day. I don’t believe in shortcuts; I’d rather grow at a steady pace and build skills that actually last.

In short, I’m at the beginning of my journey, but I’m committed to making something meaningful out of these four years. I’m Sameer Choudhary—a first-year CSE student, a learner, and someone who believes that with patience, effort, and a clear mindset, anything can be built from the ground up.
